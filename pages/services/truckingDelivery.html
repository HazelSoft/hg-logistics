                            HG Logistics is a full-service logistics broker and freight carrier. Whatever your business
                            needs to ship, wherever you need it, we’ll get it there. Safe and sound. We offer a wide
                            variety of freight & logistics services, from local LTL shipping to nationwide TL transport
                            and even international freight services. HG Logistics competitive rates and devotion to
                            customer service make shipping with us stress-free.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="pb-2">Less Than Truckload (LTL) Shipping</h3>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            LTL shipping, or less than truckload shipping, refers to any freight too big for a package
                            carrier, but too small for a full truckload. Your products will share truck space with
                            freight from other businesses, and you’ll only pay for the space your items take up. This
                            makes LTL an economic solution for businesses who only ship small skids or crated items.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="pb-2">Full Truckload (TL) Shipping</h3>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            TL, or truckload shipping, is ideal for businesses with larger freight needs. Your freight
                            will be the only thing aboard the truck, and your products will move from their origin to
                            their destination without being transferred. For businesses who need to ship in mass
                            quantities, TL shipping with HG Logistics is ideal for distributing your freight as quickly
                            as possible.
