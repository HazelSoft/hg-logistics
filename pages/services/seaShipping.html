                        <p class="pb-3">
                            It has been estimated that over 90% of the world trade transpires via sea. Goods are
                            transported across the seas from port to port. Sea shipping or ocean freight is the service
                            provided by the transporters, so you can send and receive your goods from overseas. Our
                            expert team at HG Logistics provide proficient sea shipping logistics which install your
                            cargo in a vessel that suits your needs the best. Our shipping services handle your
                            logistics in a way that makes you feel confident enough to focus your attention on other
                            more important things. HG Logistics provides its excellent and reliable services, not in
                            Pakistan but the world over. So no matter if your cargo is coming in out of Pakistan, or
                            whether it is an import or an export, our sea cargo services will make sure your goods reach
                            their destination safely.
