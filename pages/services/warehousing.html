                            HG Logistics takes great pride in our precision and organization. We track all our inventory
                            through a superior digital system. From the moment your product arrives on our docks, we
                            know exactly where it is, and we’ll get it where you need it on time. Here’s how we do it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong> Arrival:</strong> When we receive your products on the HG Logistics docks, we
                                immediately take stock and check them against the packing list. If there are any
                                discrepancies or damage, you’ll be immediately notified.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Storage:</strong> Once we’ve verified that your products are safe and
                                accounted for, we place them into storage in our climate-controlled warehouse. You’ll
                                receive a signed copy of the packing list for your records. Rest assured warehouse
                                safety is always on the front of our minds
                            </li>

                                <strong>Retrieval:</strong> When it’s time to ship your products, we
                                retrieve them from storage and ready them for transport. We stretch-wrap and label every
                                palette so they arrive with the look of professionalism you desire.
